# ExpressRoute monitoring, metrics, and alerts

This article helps you understand ExpressRoute monitoring, metrics, and alerts using Azure Monitor. Azure Monitor is one stop shop for all metrics, alerting, diagnostic logs across all of Azure.
 
>[!NOTE]
>Using **Classic Metrics** is not recommended.
>

## Circuit metrics

To navigate to **Metrics**, click the ExpressRoute page for the circuit that you want to monitor. Under **Monitoring**, you can view the **Metrics**. Select from the metrics listed below. The default aggregation will be applied. Optionally, you can apply splitting, which will show the metrics with different dimensions.

### Metrics Available: 
* **Availability** 
    * Arp Availability
      * Dimensions Available:
        * Peer (Primary/Secondary ExpressRoute router)
        * Peering Type (Private/Public/Microsoft)
    * Bgp Availability
      * Dimensions Available:
        * Peer (Primary/Secondary ExpressRoute router)
        * Peering Type (Private/Public/Microsoft)
    * Rx and Tx Light Levels
      * Dimensions Available:
        * ExpressRoute Direct
    * Admin State
      * Dimensions Available: 
        * ExpressRoute Direct
    * Line Protocol
      * Dimensions Available
        * ExpressRoute Direct
* **Traffic**
    * BitsInPerSecond
      * Dimensions Available:
        * Peering Type (Private/Public/Microsoft)
        * ExpressRoute Direct
    * BitsOutPerSecond
      * Dimensions Available:
        * Peering Type (Private/Public/Microsoft)
        * ExpressRoute Direct
    * GlobalReachBitsInPerSecond
      * Dimensions Available:
        * Peered Circuit Skey (Service Key)
    * GlobalReachBitsOutPerSecond
      * Dimensions Available:
        * Peered Circuit Skey (Service Key)

>[!NOTE]
>Using *GlobalGlobalReachBitsInPerSecond* and *GlobalGlobalReachBitsOutPerSecond* will only be visible if at least one Global Reach connection is established.

## Bits In and Out - Metrics across all peerings

You can view metrics across all peerings on a given ExpressRoute circuit.

## Bits In and Out - Metrics per peering

You can view metrics for private, public, and Microsoft peering in bits/second.

![metrics per peering](./media/expressroute-monitoring-metrics-alerts/erpeeringmetrics.jpg) 

## BGP Availability - Split by Peer  

You can view near to real-time availability of BGP across peerings and peers (Primary and Secondary ExpressRoute routers). This dashboard shows the Primary BGP session up for private peering and the Second BGP session down for private peering.

## ARP Availability - Split by Peering  

You can view near to real-time availability of [ARP](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/expressroute/expressroute-troubleshooting-arp-resource-manager) across peerings and peers (Primary and Secondary ExpressRoute routers). This dashboard shows the Private Peering ARP session up across both peers, but complete down for Microsoft peering across peerings. The default aggregation (Average) was utilized across both peers.

## ExpressRoute gateway connections in bits/seconds

## Alerts for ExpressRoute gateway connections

1. In order to configure alerts, navigate to **Azure Monitor**, then click **Alerts**.

2. Click **+Select Target** and select the ExpressRoute gateway connection resource.

3. Define the alert details.

4. Define and add the action group.

## Configure alerts for activity logs on circuits

In the **Alert Criteria**, you can select **Activity Log** for the Signal Type and select the Signal.
